-rw-r--r--  1 root  staff  0 Jun 24 22:52 test_file

User changed to root

Rajats-MacBook-Pro-3:test root# chgrp admin test_file
Rajats-MacBook-Pro-3:test root# ls -ltr
total 0
-rw-r--r--  1 root  admin  0 Jun 24 22:52 test_file

group changed to admin

to check the available groups check /etc/group file 


Now go back to previous login, and check if you are able to delete the file which is now owned by root.

Rajats-MacBook-Pro-3:test root# exit
logout

[Mon Jun 24 23:04:29 Rajat]:test>whoami
rohanrajat
[Mon Jun 24 23:04:33 Rajat]:test>cat test_file 
[Mon Jun 24 23:04:37 Rajat]:test>rm test_file 
override rw-r--r--  root/admin for test_file? y
[Mon Jun 24 23:05:05 Rajat]:test>ls -ltr

we are able to delete the file. 
Reason for the same is, rohanrajat is still the owner of the directory under which this file was present, and this user
has all read write permissions

drwxr-xr-x   2 rohanrajat  staff    64 Jun 24 23:05 test

Under /etc directory only root has permissions to create and update files 

Now, if you try to create a new file under this directory, you will not have permission, until you are logged in as
root. 
[Mon Jun 24 23:09:23 Rajat]:etc>touch myfile
touch: myfile: Permission denied

Once, logged in as root you can create the file
